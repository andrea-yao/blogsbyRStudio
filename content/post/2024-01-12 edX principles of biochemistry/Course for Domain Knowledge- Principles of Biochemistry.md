All living organisms on earth used one of two sources of energy: sunlight or potential energy stored in food. A living organism using sunlight as a source of energy is called a phototroph. 
A living organism extracting energy from chemical molecules is called a chemotroph. Among chemotrophs you find lithotrophs using inorganic molecules as fuel, organotrophs that extract energy from organic molecules. 
To obtain carbon for building biomolecules, autotrophs fix carbon dioxide, while heterotrophs rely on organic molecules. 
\
life involves a constant flow of matter and energy among living organisms. The flow of matter is cyclical. Autotrophs, such as plants, generate organic molecules and oxygen that will be used by heterotrophs. in turn, heterotrophs produce water and carbon dioxide used by autotrophs. 
\
The first law of thermodynamics:
Food, chemical energy, kinetic energy, 
Similarly, a molecule possesses potential energy, which is stored in chemical bonds. there may be differences in how molecule A is converted to molecule B, with a different energy potential. But the change of potential energy will remain the same, regardless of the path used to go from A to B. 
\
The second law of thermodynamics:
the energy is transfered in a way that increases the randomness of the universe. the randomness is also called entropy. A spontaneous increase of entropy can be illustrated by the unavoidable decay of a sandcastle under the action of the winds or the rising tide. 
\
all the time our cells are synthesizing molecules, which would decrease entropy. aren't this breaking the second law of thermodynamics all the time?



### 1.1.4
Predict the direction of a reaction given the free energy, or the entropy and enthalpy parameters of the reaction.
Predict the direction of a reaction given an equilibrium constant and the initial concentrations of the substance and product of the reaction.
Calculate free energy of a reaction at the standard condition given its equilibrium constant and temperature.
