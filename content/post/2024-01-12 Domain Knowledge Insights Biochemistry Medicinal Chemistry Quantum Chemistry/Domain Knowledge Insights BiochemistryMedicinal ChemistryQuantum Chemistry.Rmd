# Crashcourse: Organic Chemistry

Biomedical engineering was learning how the tinest bits of our cells come together to make our bodies work. So much of that is rooted in the chemistry of molecules, from what they look like to how they interact with each other. 
\
organic means dealing with the carbon.there are over 16 million known organic molecules. 
\
since we can't actually see these atoms and molecules that we are talking about, we will discover how chemists make observations, do experiments, and propose theories to understand the chemical and physical properties of the molecules that make the universe tick. 
\
we will get into the multi-step synthesis of larger molecules and learn about a cornerstone drug in the fight against infection: penicillin. we also look at other important developments in the pharmaceutical industry, because you need organic chemistry to understand health, medicine, and the biochemistry of how your body works.

## 1- what is organic chemistry?
all made up of different arrangements of atoms that are bonded together, breaking apart, or reacting with each other all the time. 
\
organic chemistry is a slice of general chemistry, it is the study of molecules that have carbon atoms. \
A big part of understanding organic chemistry is grasping the logic behind everything from molecular structures to chemical reaction mechanisms. \
organic means derived from living things\
this urea is synthesized from an inorganic compound.\
\
C8H24 \
one way to represent organic molecules is with a Lewis structure.\
condensed structural formula.\
skeletal formula or line-angle formula: remove all carbons and their attached hydrogens.\
\
the atoms in organic molecules other than carbon and hydrogen are called heteroatoms.

## 2- the basics of organic nomenclature
IUPAC rules: standard rules for naming organic chemicals. \
Many chemicals had common names given to them by the people who discovered them based on their source or smell or color. 
a systematic name that follows a set of rules, which means anyone who knows those rules can draw the structure. 

## 3- more organic nomenclature: heteroatom functional groups
to recognize chemical structures and use IUPAC rules to name them.\
3 steps to name organic compounds: 1- find the longest carbon chain and give it a root name; 2- identify the highest priority functional group, give it the lowest number on the chain, and add its suffix to the root name; 3- identify any substituents and their positions on the carbon chain, then add a numbered prefix to the root name. \
recognizing the functional groups, building a molecule from a name, and naming a molecule from a structure is great. \

## 4- 3D structure and bonding
from the simpliest organic molecule, methane, to the most complex proteins, all of these compounds can be plotted on a 3D cartesian coordinate system with x, y and z axes. \
VSEPR is the theory that the 3D shape of a molecule is determined by a central atom's lone pairs of electrons and the other atoms it's bonded to. \
As scientists started to widely accept VSEPR as a way to explain the molecular shapes that they saw experimentally, quantum theory became a thing. so did the idea of orbitals, places where we are most likely to find electrons around atoms. \
there are four distinct atomic orbital names and shapes: s, p, d, and f.\
\
orbital hybridization and valence bond theory\
in fact, carbonyl groups and valence bond theory were super important to figuring out the structure of a little molecule known as DNA.
just the thing that holds our genetic information and provides the blueprint for our cells to grow and stay alive. 
\
\
we use the word isomers to describe molecules that have the same molecular formula, but different arrangement of atoms. \

## 5- IR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry
we can use instruments to learn things about molecules, like mass, different functional groups, or what geometric isomer they are. \
molecular analysis;
the main difference is that spectroscopy is just observing how electromagnetic radiation interacts with molecules, while spectrometry provides data that we can use to interpret the structure. \
\
molecules don't stand still, so IR spectroscopy can measure these molecular vibratioins by recording what wavelengths of IR radiation are absorbed. \
Even though it can be a little tedious, we want to be able to recognize different regions on an IR spectrum to make sure our data makes sense when compared to a library spectrum.
