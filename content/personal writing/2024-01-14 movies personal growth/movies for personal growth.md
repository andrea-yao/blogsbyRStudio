## 1- Movie: Where the Crawdads Sing
"a young woman who lives alone by herself is immoral". \

A little girl who was born into a broken family grew up into a totally independent woman who can fend her own world in her own way. \ 

As a young woman who don't have ambition to build a career or to change the world would probably "get hooked up" with a man whoever came into her life, with no awareness that this could be a starting of a disaster. Thus, wake up, get rid of that genetic "romantic relationship" brain, because this is not necessarily better than you by yourself, could as worse as hell. \

## 2- Book: Yellowface, by R.F. Kuang
Haven't read yet. \
But got inspired to think what if I could also write a book in English? \
