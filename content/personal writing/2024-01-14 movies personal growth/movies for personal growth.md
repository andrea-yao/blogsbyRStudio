## 1- Movie: Where the Crawdads Sing

"a young woman who lives alone by herself is immoral". \
A little girl who was born into a broken family grew up into a totally independent woman who can fend her own world in her own way. Every creature does what it must to survive. A young woman who doesn't have ambition to build a career or to change the world would "get hooked up" easily with a man whoever came into her life, without any awareness that this could be a starting of a disaster, even could be as worse as hell. \


## 2- Book: Yellowface, by R.F. Kuang
Haven't read yet. \
But got inspired to think what if I could also write a book in English? 


## 3- "I killed myself". 
Have you ever killed yourself and how were you born again? 

## 4- Song: The Let Go by Elle King
Nothing lasts forever \
Waiting for the let go\
